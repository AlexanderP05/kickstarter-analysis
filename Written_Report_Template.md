# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates
and their funding goals. We were to use 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  The biggest challange I had and am still encountring was the manipul

## Results

- *What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*
  
  One thing that is almost immediately clear, is that the 'Successful' campaigns create a near standard distribution curve, 
  with the 'Summer months' (May-August) being the best times to launch a campaign.   Secondly, The relatively flat distribution of
  'Failed' campaigns,  when compared to 'Successful' campaigns, tells us that 'Launch Date' is unlikely to be the primary 
  factor contributing to a 'Failed' cmapaign. The one notable excpetion being December, as it clearly the worst month in which to 
  launch a campaign, which is made evident by the fact it has the smallest spread between 'Successful' and 'Failed'capaigns.
  
- *What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*

  It is clear that the lower the goal of the campaign the more likely it was to be a 'Successful' campaign. 

- *What are some limitations of this dataset?*

  One o the pirmary limitation of this data set in the 
- *What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*
- I would like to see a chart comparing Launch date with campaig goal. Is there a correlation between time of year and capaign budget goal?
  I would also be curious to compare the most successful campaigns in each country and compare the types.
