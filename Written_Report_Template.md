## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
  One of the things that are almost immediately clear is the 'Successful' campaigns create a near standard distribution curve, 
  with the 'Summer months' (May-August) being the best times to launch a campaign.   Secondly, The relatively flat distribution of
  'Failed' campaigns,  when compared to 'Successful' campaigns, tells us that 'Launch Date' is unlikely to be the primary 
  factor contributing to a 'Failed' cmapaign. The one notable excpetion being December, as it has the smallest spread between 'Successful'
  and 'Failed'capaigns. This tells us that the 'Launch Date' 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
