BootCamp Module 1 Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Kickstarter Campaigns: vs Launch Date and Funding Goals 

**Purpose** 	
The purpose of this analysis was to compare how Kickstarter (KS) Campaigns fared in
comparison to their launch date and their campaign fundraising goals respectively using Pivot Tables
and line graphs. We want to try and determine, when is the best time to launch a Theatre Kickstarter 
Campaign and what fundraising target is most likely to be successfully met.

**Analysis of Data**

*Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date:
 
Don’t Launch a Campaign in December! When first looking at the ‘Theatre Outcomes Based on 
Launch Date’ it is clear that December is the worst month in which to launch a KS Campaign.  It is also 
evident that the 2nd Quartile, (April-June) is not only the best time to launch a KS Theatre Campaign but 
overall the best time to launch any and all campaign, on average. Same holds true for December being 
the worst time to launch any campaign. If you are looking to launch a campaign with the goal of being 
the most successful, you should stick to music. The other notable observation is that other than music, 
the ‘Theatre’ is the least volatile of any of the campaign categories. 

Outcomes Based on Goals:
	Campaigns with goals equal to or larger than $45000 have a 91.5% failure rate compared to a 
74.5% success rate for campaigns with goals at $5000 or less. It makes sense that the lower the goals 
the easier it is for one to achieve that, regardless of what the campaign is raising funds for. What is 
interesting is that the flattening out of the success rate AND failure rates of campaign goals between 
$35000-44999. There are relatively few project in this range but it those in that range were 2x as likely 
to succeed than to fail. This tells also tells us that the budget in that range is conducive to successful 
show.   

**Results:**

Conclusions:

	One thing that is almost immediately clear, is that the 'Successful' campaigns create a near standard 
distribution curve, with the 'Summer months' (May-August) being the best times to launch a campaign.   
Secondly, The relatively flat distribution of 'Failed' campaigns, when compared to 'Successful' 
campaigns, tells us that 'Launch Date' is unlikely to be the primary factor contributing to a 'Failed' 
campaign. The one notable exception being December, as it clearly the worst month in which to launch 
a campaign, which is made evident by the fact it has the smallest spread between 'Successful' and 
'Failed' campaigns.  It is also clear that the lower the goal of the campaign the more likely it was to be a 
'Successful' campaign.

Limitations:
	One of the issues I came up against was particularly with the ‘Theatre Outcomes Based on 
Launch Dates’. It tells us nothing about the productions themselves and whether the subject of the plays 
had anything to do with it’s success or failure.  I would also like to know what definition/threshold is of 
failed vs canceled campaigns.  

Additional Tables and Graphs:
I would like to see a chart comparing launch dates with campaign goals. Is there a correlation 
between time of year and campaign budget goal? I would also be curious to compare the most 
successful campaigns in each country and compare how the type of each campaign fairs relative to the 
‘Campaign Goal’ set. Does the time of year in a specific country lend itself to a specific type of 
campaign?
